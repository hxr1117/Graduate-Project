### Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection normally is a binary classification, and use F-measure to evaluate the outcome.

#### Approaches

- Supervised:
  
  - Decision Tree
  
  - SVM
  
  - LR

- Unsupervised:
  
  - Classification
  
  - Isolation Forest
  
  - PCA
  
  - Invariant Mining
  
  - <u>Clustering</u>

### Remaining Questions and Challenges

Lack of visualisation tools to help developers understand the reported anomalies.
